			<h1>Where Our Food Comes From</h1>
			<h2>What Places Supply Us With Food?</h2>
			<p1>There are many places in the world that supply us with food, from the home kitchen, to restaurants, grocery stores, and so fourth. </p1>
			<p1>But where does our food origionate from? Well our food just so happens to mainly be sourced off of farms managed by farmhands. </p1>
			<p1>Now this might sound like a narrow topic, but actually there's many different types of farms that farmers tend to manage. </p1>
			<p1>There's crop farms, animal farms, fish farms, hunting ranges, tree fields, algae farms, and many other types of farms out there. </p1>
			<h2>How Does Our Food Get Supplied To Us?</h2>
			<p1>Often times the places where our food comes from are not within the same state that us Americans live in. So how does our food travel? </p1>
			<p1>Our food gets to us through the transportation services such as semis, vans, boats, trains, planes, drones, horseback and other modes of travel. </p1>
