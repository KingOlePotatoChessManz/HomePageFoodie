			<h1>Environmental And Cultural Food Impacts</h1>
			<h2>What Are The Deeper Impacts In Regards To Food</h2>
			<p1>The environmental list of correlation in regards to food is a suprisingly extreme and long list that one may not believe or even think of.</p1>
			<p1>Whilst the cultural list of correlation in regards to food is another similar type of agenda, in which holds unexpected amounts of weight.</p>
			<h2>Enironmental Impacts</h2>
			<p1>The environmental impacts in regards to food hold a suprising amount of importance, as without the environment in which to aquire food</p1>
			<p1>How can it be expected for food to be avaliable to be provided to the tables of those whom in which want something to eat.</p1>
			<p1>Whether or not food comes from a lab or from trees, it has some kind of impact on the environment as a whole.</p1>
			<h2>Cultural Impacts</h2>
			<p1>The culture of people define many factors of their lives, such as modern Christians valuing the lives of animals, but people from the Medieval era</p1>
			<p1>May not hold the same values in regards to how they see things. A very common impact culture can have on food is how much the food ends up being cooked.</p1>
			<p1>More modern societies tend to cook food to the point of being well done, and follow cook books, while other societies rely on memory and niche judgement.</p1>
