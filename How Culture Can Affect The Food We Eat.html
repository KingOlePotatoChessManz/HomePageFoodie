			<h1>How Culture Can Affect The Food We Eat</h1>
			<h2>Traditional Values And Food</h2>
			<p1>Tradition can have a very serious impact on food. There's many people in the world who limit themselves due to traditions. </p>
			<p1>Food is no exception to that, as Catholics and Monks are two different types of people known to have limited their food intake. </p>
			<p1>In thw instance of Catholics they limit themselves to poor food, mainly the nuns. Whilst monks don't eat anything during a certain time of day. </p>
			<h2>Get Togethers And Food</h2>
			<p1>There are many holidays and get togethers that are known to americans, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years, Weddings, Funerals, and much much more. </p>
			<p1>A very important part of the these get togethers is the food involved in them and how it brings people together, definetly leading to worthwhile times. </p>
