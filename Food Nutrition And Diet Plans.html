			<h1>Food Nutrition And Diet Plans</h1>
			<h2>What Is Nutrition</h2>
			<p1>Nutrition includes many things that relate to the value and importance of the food you eat, some bad, some good, but genrally a complex combo of good and bad</p1>
			<p1>some people think that nutritional values are completely black and white on whether or not they are good or bad, but there's a lot of gray area regarding nutrition.</p>
			<h2>Health Impacts</h2>
			<p1>There's a lot of hidden and unexpected health impacts that come in regards to food, whilst eating something</p1>
			<p1>typically one doesn't think about just how much of an impact it can actually have on their health.</p1>
			<p1>Whether someone eats a meal they've ate 1000 times before, or if it's a new concoction, there's always risks to certain foods.</p1>
			<h2>Food Diets</h2>
			<p1>A large many people go on dieting in order to reduce their weight and attempt to become healthier but by dieting they're limiting themselves of nutrition.</p1>
			<p1>Whilst not all diets are bad for health if someone's eating bad food anyway, a person who eats healthy food that goes on a diet suffers significantly from that diet.</p1>
			<p1>There is a very large arguable list of issues with dieting and the harmful effects it can have if taken to the extremes, as there's base needs to nutrition.</p1>
