			<h1>The Impact of Food On The Economy</h1>
			<h2>What Influences Did Food Have In Regards To Economics?</h2>
			<p1>Food used to have a massive influence over the economy. Back in the Medieval Era's food was above gold in trading value. </p1>
			<p1>Native Americans considered food to be the only valuable trading commodity for a certain amount of time. </p1>
			<p1>And there is many famous literacy works about how gold has no value to a starving man in reference to how valued food can be. </p1>
			<h2>What Influence Does Food Have In Regards To The Current Economy?</h2>
			<p1>In regards to the current economy the value of food has significantly reduced since the Industrial Age came about. </p1>
			<p1>But that does not mean that food is not still a valuable commodity in some way, as it is quite essential for human survival. </p1>
			<p1>In fact there is still many places in the world such as Afric, India, and China where starvation is a real issue for the people. </p1>
